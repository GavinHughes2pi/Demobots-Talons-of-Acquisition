# Talons of Acquisition
TOA is an Demobots-made arcade-style skill crane/claw machine project based on Ryan Bate's design for his [Arduino Claw Machine](http://www.retrobuiltgames.com/the-build-page/arduino-claw-machine/). TOA is currently **a work in progress** and is still in the process of building a functional prototype. 

## Features
 - Arduino based control/motion system
 - Servo actuated four-finger claw
 - Servo winded winch for lowering/raising claw
 - 2-stepper gantry akin to a CNC machine or FDM 3D-Printer for X/Y movement of claw
 - Arcade style joystick and button input
